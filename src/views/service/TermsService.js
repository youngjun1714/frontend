            <div className="policy__content">
              <p>
                By placing a bid or an order through Art de Finance&apos;s
                services, you acknowledge that you are making a binding offer to
                purchase Artworks or Services. Your order is accepted and
                confirmed once your purchase is complete, and THE FLUX displays
                the Confirmation Page. Once an Artwork is purchased, there are
                no refunds or returns allowed, unless statutory warranties or
                guarantees that cannot be excluded or limited by law apply.
                Partners or second sellers may offer certain rights to holders
                of their Artworks, such as physical items, special access, or
                exclusive content (collectively referred to as &quot;Additional
                Items&quot;). Any Additional Items will be provided directly to
                you by the Partners or galleries, and Art de Finance is not
                involved in such transactions nor is it a party to such
                transactions. However, Art de Finance may allow the Creator or
                Publisher to publish a description of Additional Items on the
                site. If you own Artworks that entitle you to Additional Items,
                you agree to Art de Finance sharing your contact information
                with the Partner or Gallery to facilitate delivery of your
                Additional Items. Please note that transactions on the Secondary
                Market are only for Artworks and do not grant the purchaser any
                right to Additional Items unless stated otherwise. Art de
                Finance acts as the agent for the seller in receiving payments
                for Artworks. If you are a seller of Artworks, you appoint Art
                de Finance as your agent for the limited purpose of receiving,
                holding, and settling payments made by buyers of the Artworks
                you sell. When a buyer makes a payment to us on the
                seller&apos;s behalf, the payment satisfies the buyer&apos;s
                obligation to the seller in the amount of the payment received.
                If we fail to make such payment to a seller as described in
                these Terms of Use, the seller&apos;s recourse is limited to Art
                de Finance and not to the buyer, as the payment is considered
                made by the buyer to the seller upon receipt by us. The seller
                also agrees that we are not liable for their acts and omissions,
                to the extent permissible under the rules of any third-party or
                governmental body with jurisdiction over us. We disclaim any
                such liability.

                Finance&apos;s response may depend on relevant aggravating or

                account if it is the subject of three valid infringement
                notices.
